#We have dropped Temperature from data stations at each sampled stands; 
#Wind, T, Precipitation, interaction of Time.period and Immission is used in final model for better fit of AIC and LKT
#Wind has a non-linear and slightly positive effect, with the strongest increase in abundance at higher wind speeds. This suggests wind may facilitate either beetle dispersal or trap performance under certain conditions.

#What the graph shows:
The vertical axis (y-axis) shows the level of SO‚ÇÇ pollution over time.

The horizontal axis (x-axis) shows the progression of time starting from April 15, 1989.

Each point represents a measurement. The bigger the point, the larger the difference between what the model predicted and what was actually measured (these differences are called residuals).

The black curve shows the overall trend in SO‚ÇÇ pollution estimated by your model, with a light gray area around it showing the model‚Äôs uncertainty.

The three vertical red lines mark important policy changes:
  
In 1991: a policy change began.

In 2002: pollution regulations were updated.

In 2012: a new air protection act came into force.

üü° What it means:
  SO‚ÇÇ pollution clearly decreased over the 26-year period.

The drop was strongest in the early years, especially before 2002.

After 2002, pollution levels leveled off and stayed low.

The largest modeling errors (biggest points) happened before 2000, suggesting:
  
  Either SO‚ÇÇ levels were harder to predict in the early years,

Or that the model fits the later years much better.

After the 2002 and 2012 policy changes, both pollution and residuals stayed low, which supports the idea that the regulations were effective.

üü† In summary:
  Your model shows a clear improvement in air quality over time.

The biggest deviations between predicted and observed values happened early in the timeline.

The pattern matches well with the timing of policy interventions, suggesting they likely had a positive impact.
